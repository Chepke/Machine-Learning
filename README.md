EDA steps

i) Import libraries;

      Panda for
      
      Numpy
      
      Matplotlib
      
      Seaborn
      
      Scipy.stats
      
      Sklearn
      
      Scipy
      
i) Import data set from the file file path

ii) Clean and preprocess data to find missing values from the data set

iii) Conduct a descriptive statistics summary on the variable 'charges' to determine the mean, maximmum and minimum value and the standard deviation

iv) Visualize data from the column 'charges' using a histogram

v) Determine the skewness and kurtosis of the data distribution in the histogram

       Results
          Skewness: The distribution of charges among the students are skewed to the right(towards the mean)
          Kurtosis: Flatter distribution- there is a widder spread of charges around the mean and a larger standard deviation 
 vi) Conduct a bivariate analysis;
 
 Using scattered plot to determine how 'age' affects the 'charges' values
 
      Results
        Older students are charged more compared to young students
        
 Using box plot to determine how 'smokers' affects 'charges' values
 
      Results
        The charges for smokers are high compared to that of non-smokers
        
  vii) Conduct a multivariate analysis;
  
  Using a correlative matrix; 
  
  To determine the relationship between all the variables
  
  To determine the relationship of 'charges' with the rest of the variables
  
  viii) Construct a scattered paired plot to convey how diffferent variables relate with each other.
